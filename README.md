# AIM:
To do the DC analysis,Transient and AC analysis of a CS amplifier circuit and extract the various parameters associated using LT Spice
# INTRODUCTION:
A monostable multivibrator is a timing circuit that produces a single output pulse when triggered. Using the 555 Timer IC in monostable mode, this project aims to design and simulate a circuit that generates a 0.5 microsecond pulse in response to a trigger signal. The timing of the pulse is controlled by external resistor and capacitor values
# THEORY
A monostable multivibrator is a circuit that has one stable state and one temporary (quasi-stable) state. When an external trigger is applied, the circuit switches from its stable state to the temporary state for a predetermined time interval and then returns to the stable state automatically.

The 555 Timer IC, when configured in monostable mode, functions as a reliable one-shot pulse generator. Initially, the output of the 555 timer is LOW. When a negative trigger pulse (voltage drop below 1/3 of Vcc) is applied to the trigger pin (pin 2), the output switches to HIGH. This state is maintained for a duration 
𝑇
T, determined by the external resistor 
𝑅
R and capacitor 
𝐶
C, and then returns to LOW.

The pulse duration is given by the formula:

To generate a pulse of 0.5 microseconds, suitable values of 
𝑅
R and 
𝐶
C must be carefully chosen, typically requiring small capacitor values in the picofarad (pF) range and resistors in the kilo-ohm (kΩ) range.

During operation:

Trigger: A negative pulse applied to pin 2

Output: Goes HIGH for the time

# WORKING:
In the monostable mode, the 555 Timer IC has one stable state (LOW output) and one temporary state (HIGH output). The output remains LOW until the circuit receives a trigger pulse. Once triggered, the output goes HIGH for a fixed time interval and then automatically returns to LOW.

> Step-by-step Working:
Initial State (Before Triggering):

The output (pin 3) is LOW.

The capacitor 
𝐶
C connected between pin 6 (Threshold) and ground is uncharged.

The internal discharge transistor (connected to pin 7) is ON, keeping the capacitor discharged.

A]  Triggering the Circuit:

When a negative trigger pulse (voltage drops below 1/3 of Vcc) is applied to pin 2, the 555 timer is triggered.

This causes the output (pin 3) to go HIGH, and the discharge transistor turns OFF.

The capacitor now starts charging through the resistor 
𝑅
R.

B]  Timing Interval (Output HIGH):

The capacitor charges exponentially.

When the voltage across the capacitor reaches 2/3 of Vcc, the internal comparator resets the flip-flop.

The output goes LOW again.

The discharge transistor turns ON, quickly discharging the capacitor, readying the circuit for the next trigger.

C]Time Duration of Output Pulse:

The output stays HIGH for a time 
𝑇
T calculated as:

𝑇=
1.1
×
𝑅
×
𝐶
T=1.1×R×C
After this time, the output automatically returns to LOW.

2. Circuit Setup:

Connect the 555 Timer IC as follows:

Pin 1 → GND

Pin 8 → Vcc (e.g., +5V)

Pin 4 (Reset) → Vcc (to disable reset)

Pin 5 (Control Voltage) → Ground via 0.01 µF capacitor (optional for noise reduction)

Pin 2 (Trigger) → Trigger input (push-button or signal source)

Pin 6 (Threshold) and Pin 7 (Discharge) → Connected together and to RC timing network

Between pin 7 and Vcc → Resistor

Between pin 6 and GND → Capacitor

Pin 3 (Output) → Output device (LED or oscilloscope input)

3. Simulate the Circuit (in software like LTspice, Proteus, or Multisim):

Build the circuit as per the design.

Apply a trigger pulse (short negative pulse) at pin 2.

Run the simulation and observe the output waveform at pin 3.

Check if the output pulse width is approximately 0.5 µs.

4. Verify the Output:

Measure the output pulse duration using a virtual oscilloscope.

If the pulse duration is not accurate, fine-tune 𝑅
R and 
𝐶
C values.

5. Document the Results:

Record the component values used.

Capture the output waveform.

Note the measured time duration of the output pulse.
